# Stream

Stream is the heart of Klutr—a chat-style interface where all your thoughts, files, and voice notes flow naturally and get automatically organized.

## What is Stream?

Stream replaces traditional note views with a conversational feed. Every entry you add—whether it's text, an image, a document, or a voice recording—is called a "drop." AI automatically tags and organizes your drops into Boards and Smart Tags in the background.

## Adding Drops

### Text Notes

Type your thoughts directly into the Stream input at the bottom of the screen. Press Enter to send, or Shift+Enter for a new line.

### Files and Images

- Click the paperclip icon to upload files
- Drag and drop files anywhere on the screen
- Supported formats: images, PDFs, documents

### Voice Notes

Click the microphone icon to record a voice note (coming soon).

## Viewing Your Stream

Your drops appear in chronological order, with the most recent at the bottom. Each drop shows:

- Content preview
- Auto-detected tags
- Timestamp
- File attachments (if any)

## Tags

Tags are automatically added to your drops based on content analysis. Click any tag to filter your stream and see related drops.

## Organization

Stream automatically organizes your drops into Boards based on topics and themes. You don't need to manually categorize—just drop your thoughts and let Klutr handle the rest.
