# Spark

Spark is your contextual AI assistant that helps you explore and understand your notes more deeply. Ask Spark questions about your notes, and it will provide thoughtful analysis and insights.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Note**: Enter the ID of the note you want to explore
2. **Ask a Question**: Type what you'd like to know or explore about the note
3. **Get Insights**: Spark analyzes the note and provides contextual responses in real-time

## Example Questions

- "What are the main themes in this note?"
- "How does this relate to my other ideas?"
- "What action items can I extract from this?"
- "What are the potential implications of this thought?"

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: More specific questions yield better insights
- **Context Matters**: Spark works best with notes that have substantial content
- **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics

## Tips

- Use Spark to uncover connections you might have missed
