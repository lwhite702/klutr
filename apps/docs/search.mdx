# Search

Search helps you find any drop in your stream using natural language queries. No need to remember exact words or phrases—just describe what you're looking for.

## How Search Works

### Natural Language Queries

Search understands conversational language:

- **"notes about project planning"** - Finds drops related to project planning
- **"files from last week"** - Shows files uploaded in the past week
- **"thoughts on AI"** - Finds all drops mentioning AI
- **"meeting notes"** - Locates drops tagged with meeting-related tags

### Fuzzy Matching

Search doesn't require exact matches:

- Finds similar words and phrases
- Handles typos and variations
- Matches partial words
- Understands synonyms

## Using Search

### Basic Search

1. Navigate to **Search** in the sidebar
2. Type your query in the search box
3. Results appear as you type
4. Click any result to view the full drop

### Search Filters

Refine your search with filters:

- **By Date** - Recent, last week, last month, all time
- **By Type** - Text, files, images, voice notes
- **By Tags** - Filter by specific tags
- **By Board** - Search within specific boards

### Advanced Search Tips

**Use Quotes for Exact Phrases**

- `"project planning"` - Finds exact phrase
- `project planning` - Finds drops with both words

**Combine Terms**

- `work AND meeting` - Both terms must appear
- `work OR personal` - Either term can appear
- `work NOT personal` - Excludes personal drops

**Search by Metadata**

- `tag:work` - Drops with "work" tag
- `type:file` - Only file drops
- `board:project-x` - Drops in specific board
