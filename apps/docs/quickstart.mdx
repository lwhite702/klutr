# Getting Started

Welcome to Klutr! This guide will help you capture your first drop and understand how the Stream interface works.

## Your First Drop

### 1. Open Stream

Navigate to **Stream** in the sidebar. This is your conversational workspace where all your thoughts flow naturally.

### 2. Add Your First Drop

You can add drops in several ways:

**Text Note**
- Type your thought in the input at the bottom
- Press Enter to send, or Shift+Enter for a new line

**File or Image**
- Click the paperclip icon to upload files
- Drag and drop files anywhere on the screen
- Supported formats: images, PDFs, documents

**Voice Note**
- Click the microphone icon to record (coming soon)

### 3. Watch It Organize

That's it! Your drop is automatically:

- **Saved** to your stream
- **Tagged** by AI with relevant tags
- **Organized** into Boards based on topics

## Understanding Auto-Organization

When you add a drop, our AI analyzes the content and automatically:

- **Detects tags** (work, personal, creative, etc.)
- **Groups into Boards** (related drops are grouped together)
- **Identifies patterns** (connections between ideas)

You'll see tags appear below your drop within seconds, and related drops will be grouped into Boards automatically.

## Exploring Boards

Boards are automatically created collections that group related drops from your Stream:

- **Topic similarity** - drops about the same subject
- **Tag patterns** - drops with similar tags
- **AI analysis** - themes identified by our AI

### Viewing Boards

1. Navigate to **Boards** in the sidebar
2. See your drops organized into topic boards
3. Click any board to see related drops
4. Pin important boards to keep them at the top

## Managing Your Drops

### Stream Drops

- **Create** - Add text, files, or voice notes to your Stream
- **Edit** - Click any drop to modify content
- **Delete** - Remove drops you no longer need
- **Search** - Use natural language search to find drops

### Vault Notes (Encrypted)

For sensitive thoughts:

1. Navigate to **Vault**
2. Set your encryption password
3. Create encrypted notes that only you can read
4. Your vault password is never stored on our servers

## Weekly Insights with Muse

Every week, Muse generates insights about your thinking patterns:

- **Top Tags** - what you think about most
- **Recurring Topics** - ideas that keep coming back
- **Idea Patterns** - connections between different concepts

View these in the **Muse** section.

## Tips for Success

### Capture Everything

Don't filter your thoughts. The more drops you add to your Stream, the better the AI becomes at understanding your patterns.

### Use Natural Language

Write as you would speak. The AI understands conversational language better than formal writing.

### Review Regularly

Check your Boards and Muse insights weekly to discover connections you might have missed.

### Secure Sensitive Thoughts

Use the Vault for personal reflections, confidential work notes, or anything you want to keep private.
