# Welcome to Klutr

Klutr helps you think freely — and organizes the rest.

Klutr is a conversational workspace where all your input—text, voice, images, files—flows naturally through a Stream interface and gets automatically organized on the backend.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Klutr uses a Stream-first design:

- **Chat-style interface** - Drop thoughts like messages in a conversation
- **Auto-organization** - AI tags and groups your drops into Boards automatically
- **Smart Tags** - Discover patterns through automatically detected tags
- **Zero-friction capture** - Add text, files, or voice notes instantly
- **Encrypted Vault** - Keep sensitive thoughts secure with client-side encryption

## How It Works

1. **Drop** - Add notes, files, or voice recordings to your Stream
2. **Tag** - AI automatically detects tags and organizes your drops
3. **Board** - Related drops are grouped into Boards automatically
4. **Discover** - Muse provides weekly insights about your patterns
5. **Secure** - Store sensitive notes in your encrypted Vault

## Your Data, Your Control

- **Zero-knowledge encryption** for sensitive notes
- **Client-side processing** - your thoughts stay private
- **Export anytime** - your data belongs to you
- **No vendor lock-in** - standard formats and APIs
