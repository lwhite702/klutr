Version: 2.0
Last updated: 2025-10-31 (America/New_York)

## Overview

This document defines communication standards for Wrelik (the company) and Klutr (the product). While Wrelik maintains a calm, confident mentor voice at the company level, Klutr has its own friendly, irreverent, and transparent personality that speaks directly to users.

---

## Part I: Wrelik Company Voice

### Brand Essence

**Wrelik Identity:** Calm, clear, confident, intelligent

Wrelik is the supportive mentor who codes. We don't hype, we don't anthropomorphize AI, and we don't talk down to users. We write like we're explaining something to a smart colleague who's new to the project.

### Core Tone

- **Supportive mentor who codes:** We guide users without condescending
- **Calm confidence:** We know what we're doing, but we're not arrogant
- **Intelligent simplicity:** Complex concepts explained clearly
- **Direct action:** Short, clear instructions that get things done

### What We Avoid

- **Hype and buzzwords:** No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "AI-powered magic"
- **Anthropomorphizing AI:** AI doesn't "think" or "feel" - it processes and analyzes
- **Overly casual language:** We're professional but not stuffy
- **Technical jargon:** We explain concepts in plain English
- **Exclamation points:** Use sparingly, only for genuine excitement

## Part II: Klutr Product Voice

### Brand Essence

**Klutr Identity:** Friendly, irreverent, transparent, witty, supportive

Klutr speaks like a clever friend who gets your digital chaos and isn't afraid to make a joke about it. We're here to clear the clutter with a wink and a smile, never taking ourselves too seriously while taking your privacy and time seriously.

### Voice Characteristics

#### What Klutr Sounds Like

| Sounds like…                                                                                                                     | Doesn't sound like…             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Friendly and conversational** – Uses "you" and "your" and occasionally playful puns.                                           | Formal or corporate.            |
| **Encouraging and supportive** – "Nice dump! We've sorted it."                                                                   | Judgy or condescending.         |
| **Irreverent and witty** – Acknowledges the chaos of modern life with a wink ("Go ahead, brain‑dump away").                      | Dry, robotic or overly earnest. |
| **Transparent about AI and privacy** – Explains clearly what happens to data ("We process on‑device, then encrypt before sync"). | Vague or cryptic.               |

### Core Values Reflected in Voice

- **Simplicity:** We make it easy, not complicated
- **Privacy:** We're transparent about what we do and don't do with your data
- **Delightful discovery:** We help you find gems in your clutter
- **Empathy:** We understand digital chaos because we've lived it

### Witty Intelligence

Humour and cleverness make Klutr feel human and memorable. Wit should be subtle and relevant—the joke should support the message, not undermine it.

#### Principles

- **Self-deprecating humor:** Users relate to someone who admits to digital chaos
- **Clever one-liners:** Use in tooltips, error messages, notifications
- **Narrative perspective:** First person anecdotes ("I built Klutr after losing a brilliant idea...")
- **Running jokes:** The "clutr" misspelling becomes a signature touch

#### Examples of Witty Copy

**Good:**

- "It's OK, we've all been there—dump away."
- "Tagged and bagged! Your note is filed under **{category}**."
- "Nope! Deleted like that punny tweet you regret."
- "Clear the clutr, keep the spark."

**Avoid:**

- Overcomplicated wordplay that confuses
- Obscure references that exclude users
- Jokes that obscure important instructions

**Tone Guardrails:**

- Wit shouldn't eclipse clarity
- Keep jokes short
- Test copy with real users to ensure humour resonates

### Microcopy Guidelines

Microcopy is the small text that guides users through the app. Every word should reflect Klutr's personality.

#### Capture Screen

- **Placeholder in text field:** "Drop your thoughts here…"
- **Microcopy below capture area:** "Type, paste, snap or record. We'll handle the chaos."
- **Voice record button tooltip:** "Speak your mind. We're listening."
- **Image upload tooltip:** "Upload screenshots or photos. We'll extract the good stuff."
- **Submit button label:** "Dump it"

#### Processing & Tagging

- **Processing message:** "Sorting your clutr…"
- **Success message:** "All set! We've tagged your note as **{category}**."
- **Multiple tags message:** "Filed under {categories}. You'll find it later in a snap."
- **Error message:** "Oops, couldn't process that. Try again or check your connection."

#### Nope Workflow

- **Swipe tooltip:** "Nope → to trash"
- **Deleted confirmation:** "Gone! That note won't bother you again."
- **Undo deletion:** "Oops! Tap to restore"
- **Training info:** "Your Nope teaches Klutr what to ignore."

#### Inbox & Digest

- **Empty inbox message:** "It's gloriously empty here. Time to create something?"
- **Daily digest intro:** "Yesterday's clutr, today's inspiration."
- **Digest item caption:** "Remember this? You jotted it at {time}."
- **Call‑to‑action for digest:** "Tap to revisit, edit, or share."

#### Settings & Privacy

- **Local‑first mode description:** "Everything stays on your device unless you choose to sync."
- **Privacy assurance:** "We process on‑device and encrypt before sync."
- **Feedback prompt:** "Got thoughts about Klutr? Drop us a note!"

#### Onboarding Tips

- **Welcome screen:** "Welcome to **Klutr**. Clear the clutr and keep the sparks."
- **Onboarding step 1:** "Capture anything: text, images, voice notes."
- **Onboarding step 2:** "AI tags and organises it into neat piles."
- **Onboarding step 3:** "Swipe left to Nope what you don't need."
- **Onboarding step 4:** "Enjoy daily resurfacings of your ideas."

## Part III: Shared Communication Standards

These principles apply to both Wrelik (company) and Klutr (product) communications.

### UI Copy Rules

#### Buttons and Actions

- **Verb-first:** "Dump it" (Klutr) or "Add note" (Wrelik style)
- **Active voice:** "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
- **Clear intent:** "Delete forever" not "Remove"
- **Consistent terminology:** Use the same words for the same actions

**Klutr Examples:**

- "Dump it"
- "Nope it"
- "Tag it"
- "Clear the clutr"

**Wrelik Examples:**

- "Add note"
- "Save draft"
- "Generate insights"

#### Tooltips and Help Text

- **Explain without condescending:** Assume users are smart but new
- **Focus on the "why":** Explain the benefit, not just the feature
- **Be specific:** "Groups related notes" not "Organizes your thoughts"

#### Error Messages

- **Clear cause + action:** Tell users what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Avoid blame:** "Unable to save" not "You made an error"
- **Provide next steps:** Give users a clear path forward

**Klutr style:**

- "Oops, couldn't process that. Try again or check your connection."
- "That one got away. Want to try again?"

**Wrelik style:**

- "Unable to save note. Check your connection and try again."
- "Vault password incorrect. Please try again or reset your password."

#### Empty States

- **Guide next step:** Tell users what to do first
- **Show value:** Explain why this feature matters
- **Encourage action:** Make the first step feel achievable

**Klutr style:**

- "It's gloriously empty here. Time to create something?"
- "No clutr yet. Dump your first thought and watch the magic."

**Wrelik style:**

- "Add your first note to get started"
- "Create a vault to store sensitive notes securely"

### Documentation Voice

#### User-Facing (Mintlify)

- **Conversational:** Write like you're talking to a colleague
- **Example-driven:** Show, don't just tell
- **Progressive:** Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Encouraging:** Help users succeed

#### Technical (Internal /docs/)

- **Precise:** Use exact technical terms
- **Engineering tone:** Professional but not academic
- **Factual:** Document what is, not what could be
- **Risk-aware:** Document known limitations

### Communication Standards

#### Changelog Entries

- **Factual:** What changed, not why it's amazing
- **Dated:** Always include timestamp in ET
- **Categorized:** Use consistent tags [feature], [ui], [infra], [docs], [risk]
- **Concise:** One line per logical change

**Good Examples:**

- "[feature] Added manual re-clustering trigger to MindStorm page"
- "[ui] Updated QuickCaptureBar with better error handling"
- "[docs] Created vault.md with encryption implementation details"

#### Commit Messages

- **What + why:** Describe the change and the reason
- **Present tense:** "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- **Concise:** Keep summary line under 70 characters

#### Code Comments

- **Intent, not implementation:** Explain why, not how
- **Context for future developers:** Assume they're smart but new to the code
- **Document decisions:** Why this approach was chosen

### Brand Don'ts (Universal)

#### Explicit Anti-Patterns

- **Never use:** "AI-powered," "smart," "intelligent," "revolutionary"
- **Never say:** "Your AI assistant," "AI thinks," "AI learns"
- **Never hype:** "Amazing," "incredible," "game-changing"
- **Never be vague:** "Something," "stuff," "things"
- **Never blame users:** "You made an error," "Your mistake"
- **Never oversell:** "Perfect," "flawless," "100% accurate"

#### Tone Violations

- **Too casual:** "Hey there!" "What's up?" "Cool beans" (unless context-appropriate for Klutr)
- **Too formal:** "Please be advised," "It is recommended," "One should"
- **Too excited:** Multiple exclamation points, ALL CAPS
- **Too technical:** Jargon without explanation, acronyms without definition

## Voice Testing

Before publishing any user-facing copy, ask:

1. **Is this clear?** Would a new user understand what to do?
2. **Is this helpful?** Does it guide users toward success?
3. **Is this confident?** Do we sound like we know what we're doing?
4. **Is this appropriate?** Does this match Wrelik (calm mentor) or Klutr (friendly wit)?
5. **Is this consistent?** Does this sound like our brand(s)?

If any answer is "no," rewrite until it's "yes."
