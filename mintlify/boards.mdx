# Boards

Boards are automatically created collections that group related drops from your Stream. Think of them as smart folders that organize themselves.

## How Boards Work

Boards are created automatically based on:

- **Topic similarity**: Drops about the same subject are grouped together
- **Tag patterns**: Drops with similar tags form boards
- **AI analysis**: Our AI identifies themes and creates boards accordingly

## Viewing Boards

Visit the Boards page to see all your boards. Boards are sorted by:

1. **Pinned boards** (at the top)
2. **Recent activity** (most recently updated first)

Each board card shows:

- Board name and description
- Number of notes
- Associated tags
- Last activity time

## Board Details

Click any board to see all drops that belong to it. The board view filters your Stream to show only relevant drops.

## Pinning Boards

Pin important boards to keep them at the top of your list. Click the pin icon on any board card to pin or unpin it.

## Creating Boards

While boards are created automatically, you can also create them manually:

1. Go to the Boards page
2. Click "Create Board"
3. Give it a name and description
4. Add tags to define what drops should belong to it

## Tips

- Boards update automatically as you add new drops
- Pin your most-used boards for quick access
- Use board tags to control which drops appear in each board
