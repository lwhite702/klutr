# Stream

Stream is the heart of Klutr—a chat-style interface where all your thoughts, files, and voice notes flow naturally and get automatically organized. Think of it as dumping your brain into a conversation, and we'll handle the sorting.

## What is Stream?

Stream replaces traditional note views with a conversational feed. Every entry you add—whether it's text, an image, a document, or a voice recording—is called a "drop." We automatically tag and organize your drops into Boards and Smart Tags in the background, so you can focus on capturing thoughts instead of filing them.

## Adding Drops

### Text Notes

Type your thoughts directly into the Stream input at the bottom of the screen. Press Enter to send, or Shift+Enter for a new line. No need to overthink it—just dump what's on your mind.

### Files and Images

- Click the paperclip icon to upload files
- Drag and drop files anywhere on the screen
- Supported formats: images, PDFs, documents

We'll extract text from images and PDFs automatically, so everything becomes searchable.

### Voice Notes

Click the microphone icon to record a voice note. Speak naturally—we'll transcribe it and add it to your Stream with the same automatic tagging and organization.

## Viewing Your Stream

Your drops appear in chronological order, with the most recent at the bottom. Each drop shows:

- Content preview
- Auto-detected tags
- Timestamp
- File attachments (if any)

Scroll through your Stream to see your thinking unfold over time, or use tags to filter and find specific topics.

## Tags

Tags are automatically added to your drops based on content analysis. Click any tag to filter your stream and see related drops. Tags help you discover connections between ideas you might not have noticed.

## Organization

Stream automatically organizes your drops into Boards based on topics and themes. You don't need to manually categorize—just drop your thoughts and let Klutr handle the rest. The more you dump, the smarter the organization becomes.

## Tips for Using Stream

**Capture Everything**
Don't filter your thoughts. The more drops you add, the better we understand your patterns and can organize effectively.

**Use Natural Language**
Write as you would speak. Conversational language works better than formal bullet points.

**Trust the Process**
Let automatic tagging and organization do their thing. You can always refine tags later if needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Drops Not Appearing**
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Ensure you pressed Enter or clicked Send

**Tags Not Showing**
- Wait a few seconds for processing
- Ensure your drop has enough content
- Try refreshing the page

**Files Not Uploading**
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Check your internet connection
