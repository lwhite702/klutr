# Getting Started

Welcome to Klutr! This guide will help you capture your first note and understand how AI-powered organization works.

## Your First Note

### 1. Open QuickCapture

Look for the QuickCapture bar at the top of your screen. It's designed for fast, distraction-free note entry.

### 2. Type Your Thought

Write anything that comes to mind:

- Meeting notes
- Ideas for projects
- Questions you're pondering
- Observations about your day

### 3. Press Enter

That's it! Your note is automatically:

- **Saved** to your collection
- **Classified** by AI with relevant tags
- **Added** to appropriate clusters

## Understanding Classification

When you create a note, our AI analyzes the content and automatically:

- **Identifies the topic** (work, personal, creative, etc.)
- **Adds relevant tags** (meeting, idea, question, etc.)
- **Determines the context** (urgent, reference, archive, etc.)

You'll see these classifications appear below your note within seconds.

## Exploring MindStorm

MindStorm is where the magic happens. It automatically groups related notes into clusters based on:

- **Content similarity** - notes about similar topics
- **Temporal patterns** - ideas that emerge together
- **Conceptual relationships** - themes that connect across time

### Viewing Clusters

1. Navigate to **MindStorm** in the sidebar
2. See your notes organized into topic clusters
3. Click any cluster to explore related notes
4. Use "Re-cluster now" to refresh groupings

## Managing Your Notes

### Regular Notes

- **Create** - Use QuickCapture for fast entry
- **Edit** - Click any note to modify content
- **Delete** - Remove notes you no longer need
- **Search** - Find notes by content or tags

### Vault Notes (Encrypted)

For sensitive thoughts:

1. Navigate to **Vault**
2. Set your encryption password
3. Create encrypted notes that only you can read
4. Your vault password is never stored on our servers

## Weekly Insights

Every Sunday, Klutr generates insights about your note-taking patterns:

- **Most active topics** - what you think about most
- **Emerging themes** - new ideas taking shape
- **Pattern recognition** - connections you might have missed
- **Productivity insights** - when and how you're most creative

View these in the **Insights** section.

## Tips for Success

### Capture Everything

Don't filter your thoughts. The more notes you create, the better the AI becomes at understanding your patterns.

### Use Natural Language

Write as you would speak. The AI understands conversational language better than formal writing.

### Review Regularly

Check your clusters weekly to discover connections you might have missed.

### Secure Sensitive Thoughts

Use the Vault for personal reflections, confidential work notes, or anything you want to keep private.
