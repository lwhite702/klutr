# Vault

The Vault is your secure space for sensitive thoughts and confidential information. Everything you store here is encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers, ensuring complete privacy. We never see your plaintext content—not even we can read what you store in your Vault.

## How Vault Encryption Works

### Client-Side Encryption

**Your Data, Your Control**

- Encryption happens in your browser
- We never see your plaintext content
- Your encryption key never leaves your device

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**

- Servers store only encrypted data
- No backdoors or master keys
- Complete privacy protection

### Encryption Process

1. **Password Creation** - You set a vault password (we never store it)
2. **Key Derivation** - Password converted to encryption key using PBKDF2
3. **Note Encryption** - Content encrypted on your device before transmission
4. **Secure Storage** - Only encrypted data stored on servers
5. **Client Decryption** - Notes decrypted when you unlock vault with your password

The key point: encryption happens on your device. We only ever see encrypted data.

## Setting Up Your Vault

### First-Time Setup

1. **Navigate to Vault** - Click Vault in the sidebar
2. **Create Password** - Choose a strong, memorable password
3. **Confirm Password** - Re-enter to ensure accuracy
4. **Vault Ready** - Start creating encrypted notes

### Password Requirements

**Strong Password**

- At least 12 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- Avoid common words or patterns

**Password Security**

- Never share your vault password
- Don't use passwords from other accounts
- Consider using a password manager

## Creating Encrypted Notes

### Adding Vault Notes

1. **Unlock Vault** - Enter your password
2. **Create Note** - Write your sensitive content
3. **Auto-Encryption** - Content encrypted automatically
4. **Secure Storage** - Encrypted data saved to servers

### What to Store in Vault

**Personal Reflections**

- Private thoughts and feelings
- Personal goals and aspirations
- Sensitive memories

**Confidential Work**

- Proprietary information
- Client details
- Strategic planning

**Private Research**

- Sensitive findings
- Confidential sources
- Personal investigations

## Vault Security Features

### Encryption Standards

**AES-GCM Encryption**

- Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- 256-bit key strength
- Built-in authentication

**Secure Key Derivation**

- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Random salt for each user
- SHA-256 hashing

### Security Guarantees

**What We Guarantee**

- Zero-knowledge: We cannot read your vault content
- Client-side encryption: All encryption happens in your browser
- No backdoors: No way for us to access your data
- User control: You own your encryption keys

**What We Don't Guarantee**

- Browser security: We rely on your browser's security. Keep your browser updated.
- Device security: We cannot protect against compromised devices. Use secure devices.
- Password recovery: Forgotten passwords cannot be recovered. This is by design for security.
- Network security: We cannot protect against network-level attacks. Use secure networks when possible.

## Managing Your Vault

### Unlocking Your Vault

**Session Management**

- Vault stays unlocked during your session
- Automatic lock after inactivity
- Re-enter password to unlock again

**Security Reminders**

- Vault locks on browser refresh
- Password required for each new session
- No persistent key storage (by design)

### Vault Organization

**Note Management**

- Create, edit, and delete encrypted notes
- Search within vault content
- Organize by tags or categories

**Bulk Operations**

- Select multiple vault notes
- Delete or organize in batches
- Export encrypted content

## Important Security Considerations

### Password Management

**Critical: Remember Your Password**

- We cannot recover forgotten passwords
- Lost password = permanently lost vault content
- Consider using a password manager

**Password Security**

- Never share your vault password
- Don't write it down in plain text
- Use a unique password for your vault

### Browser Security

**Secure Browsers**

- Use updated, secure browsers
- Enable security features
- Avoid browser extensions that might compromise security

**Session Security**

- Log out when finished
- Don't leave vault unlocked on shared computers
- Clear browser data if needed

### Device Security

**Secure Devices**

- Keep your device updated
- Use strong device passwords
- Enable device encryption

**Network Security**

- Use secure networks when possible
- Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations
- Consider VPN for additional security

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Remember Password

**Critical:** We cannot recover forgotten passwords. This is by design—if we could recover passwords, we could decrypt your vault, which defeats the purpose of zero-knowledge encryption.

**Solutions:**
- Use a password manager to store your vault password securely
- Write down your password in a secure location (not in plain text)
- Consider creating a backup of your vault password in a secure password manager

**If you've lost your password:** Unfortunately, your vault content cannot be recovered. This is the trade-off for true zero-knowledge encryption.

### Vault Won't Unlock

- Check password spelling carefully
- Ensure caps lock is off
- Try refreshing the page

### Notes Not Saving

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure vault is properly unlocked
- Try creating a new note

### Performance Issues

- Large vaults may take time to load
- Encryption/decryption adds processing time
- Consider organizing vault content

## Best Practices

### Regular Backups

- Export vault content periodically
- Store backups securely
- Test backup restoration

### Password Security

- Use a strong, unique password
- Consider using a password manager
- Never share your vault password

### Content Organization

- Use descriptive titles for vault notes
- Organize by topic or project
- Regular cleanup of outdated content

### Security Awareness

- Understand the security model
- Know the limitations
- Stay informed about updates
