# Insights

Insights reveal patterns in your thinking that you might never notice on your own. Every week, we analyze your note-taking patterns to generate personalized insights about your thoughts, interests, and productivity. Think of Insights as your personal thinking dashboard—it shows you what you're actually thinking about, not what you think you're thinking about.
