# Muse

Muse analyzes your stream over time and provides weekly insights about your thinking patterns. Discover recurring topics, idea patterns, and connections you didn't know existed.

## How It Works

Muse runs automatically in the background, analyzing your stream drops to identify:

- **Top Tags** - The most common topics in your thinking
- **Recurring Topics** - Ideas that appear repeatedly over time
- **Idea Patterns** - Connections between different concepts

## Weekly Insights

Every week, Muse generates a summary of your thinking patterns:

### Top Tags
