# Muse

Muse analyzes your stream over time and provides weekly insights about your thinking patterns. Discover recurring topics, idea patterns, and connections you didn't know existed. Think of Muse as your thinking mirror—it shows you patterns you might not notice on your own.

## How It Works

Muse runs automatically in the background, analyzing your stream drops to identify:

- **Top Tags** - The most common topics in your thinking. See what occupies your mind most.
- **Recurring Topics** - Ideas that appear repeatedly over time. Discover themes worth exploring further.
- **Idea Patterns** - Connections between different concepts. See how your thoughts relate to each other.

All of this happens automatically—just keep adding drops, and Muse will surface insights weekly.

## Weekly Insights

Every week, Muse generates a summary of your thinking patterns:

### Top Tags

See which topics you think about most frequently. This helps you understand your focus areas and interests.

### Recurring Topics

Discover ideas that keep coming back. These might be important themes worth exploring further.

### Idea Patterns

Muse identifies connections between seemingly unrelated drops. These patterns reveal how your thoughts relate to each other.

## Viewing Your Insights

1. Navigate to **Muse** in the sidebar
2. View your weekly insights summary
3. Click any insight card to explore related drops
4. Review patterns to discover new connections

## Use Cases

- **Understand Your Thinking**: See what topics occupy your mind most
- **Discover Patterns**: Find connections between different ideas
- **Track Evolution**: See how your thoughts change over time
- **Identify Themes**: Recognize recurring concepts worth exploring

## Tips

- The more drops you add to your stream, the better Muse's insights become. Don't filter—just dump.
- Review insights weekly to stay aware of your thinking patterns. Check every Sunday for your weekly summary.
- Use insights to guide future exploration and note-taking. If a topic keeps recurring, maybe it's worth diving deeper.
- Explore connections between different ideas. Muse might surface relationships you never noticed.

## Troubleshooting

**No Insights Showing**
- Ensure you have enough drops in your stream (at least 10-20)
- Wait for the weekly processing cycle to complete
- Check that you've been adding drops consistently

**Insights Seem Generic**
- Add more descriptive content to your drops
- Include context in your notes
- Give Muse more data to work with—insights improve over time

**Missing Weekly Summary**
- Weekly summaries are generated automatically
- Check back on Sundays for your weekly insights
- Ensure you have sufficient activity in your stream
