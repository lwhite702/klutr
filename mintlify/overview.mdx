# Welcome to Notes or Nope

Notes or Nope (codename: MindStorm) is your AI-powered second brain. It helps you capture thoughts, automatically organize them into meaningful clusters, and discover patterns you never knew existed.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Notes or Nope uses AI to:

- **Automatically classify** your notes as you create them
- **Group related ideas** into clusters without manual tagging
- **Generate weekly insights** from your note-taking patterns
- **Keep sensitive thoughts secure** with client-side encryption

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Add notes quickly using the QuickCapture bar
2. **Classify** - AI automatically tags and categorizes your content
3. **Cluster** - Related notes group together in MindStorm
4. **Discover** - Weekly insights reveal patterns in your thinking
5. **Secure** - Store sensitive notes in your encrypted Vault

## Your Data, Your Control

- **Zero-knowledge encryption** for sensitive notes
- **Client-side processing** - your thoughts stay private
- **Export anytime** - your data belongs to you
- **No vendor lock-in** - standard formats and APIs
