# Welcome to Klutr

Klutr helps you think freely — and organizes the rest.

Klutr is a conversational workspace where all your input—text, voice, images, files—flows naturally through a Stream interface and gets automatically organized on the backend.

## What Makes This Different

Unlike traditional note-taking apps, Klutr uses a Stream-first design:

- **Chat-style interface** - Drop thoughts like messages in a conversation. No filing, no folders, just dump and go.
- **Auto-organization** - We automatically tag and group your drops into Boards. No manual categorization required.
- **Smart Tags** - Discover patterns through automatically detected tags. See connections you might have missed.
- **Zero-friction capture** - Add text, files, or voice notes instantly. Capture happens in seconds, not minutes.
- **Encrypted Vault** - Keep sensitive thoughts secure with client-side encryption. We never see your plaintext content.

## How It Works

1. **Drop** - Add notes, files, or voice recordings to your Stream. Just dump what's on your mind.
2. **Tag** - We automatically detect tags and organize your drops. No manual work required.
3. **Board** - Related drops are grouped into Boards automatically. Watch your thoughts organize themselves.
4. **Discover** - Muse provides weekly insights about your patterns. See what you're thinking about most.
5. **Secure** - Store sensitive notes in your encrypted Vault. Client-side encryption means we never see your content.

## Your Data, Your Control

- **Zero-knowledge encryption** for sensitive notes
- **Client-side processing** - your thoughts stay private
- **Export anytime** - your data belongs to you
- **No vendor lock-in** - standard formats and APIs
