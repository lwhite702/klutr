# Spark

Spark is your contextual AI partner that helps you explore and understand your notes more deeply. Ask Spark questions about your notes, and it will provide thoughtful analysis and insights. Think of Spark as your thinking partner—someone who's read all your notes and can help you see connections you might have missed.

## How It Works

1. **Select a Note**: Enter the ID of the note you want to explore, or select it from your Stream
2. **Ask a Question**: Type what you'd like to know or explore about the note
3. **Get Insights**: Spark analyzes the note and provides contextual responses in real-time

It's that simple. No complex setup, no learning curve—just ask questions and get answers.

## What You Can Ask

Spark can help with a variety of questions:

**Understanding Content**
- "What are the main themes in this note?"
- "Summarize the key points"
- "What's the main idea here?"

**Finding Connections**
- "How does this relate to my other ideas?"
- "What other notes touch on similar topics?"
- "Show me related thoughts"

**Extracting Value**
- "What action items can I extract from this?"
- "What are the potential implications of this thought?"
- "What should I do next based on this?"

**Exploring Ideas**
- "What questions does this raise?"
- "What are alternative perspectives?"
- "How could I develop this further?"

## Best Practices

**Be Specific**
More specific questions yield better insights. Instead of "tell me about this," try "what are the main themes in this note?"

**Context Matters**
Spark works best with notes that have substantial content. The more detail you've captured, the richer the insights.

**Iterate**
Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics. Spark remembers the conversation context, so you can build on previous questions.

**Explore Different Angles**
Try asking the same note different types of questions—analytical, creative, action-oriented—to see it from multiple perspectives.

## Tips

- Use Spark to uncover connections you might have missed
- Explore different angles by asking varied questions
- Combine Spark insights with Muse remixes for creative exploration
- Ask Spark about notes you haven't looked at in a while—it might surface forgotten gems

## Troubleshooting

**Spark Not Responding**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you've selected a note
- Try rephrasing your question

**Answers Seem Generic**
- Ask more specific questions
- Ensure your note has enough content
- Try asking about connections to other notes

**Slow Responses**
- Large notes may take longer to process
- Complex questions require more analysis time
- Check your connection speed
