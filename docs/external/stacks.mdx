# Stacks

Stacks help you organize notes by projects, themes, or any way that makes sense for your workflow. They're smart, flexible, and designed to grow with your thinking. Think of Stacks as your project folders—but smarter, because they can suggest notes and adapt as your work evolves.

## What Are Stacks?

### Smart Organization

Stacks are collections of notes organized around:

- **Projects** - Work initiatives, personal goals, creative endeavors
- **Themes** - Topics you're exploring, areas of interest
- **Contexts** - Different aspects of your life or work
- **Timeframes** - Short-term goals, long-term planning
