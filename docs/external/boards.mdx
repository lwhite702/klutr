# Boards

Boards are automatically created collections that group related drops from your Stream. Think of them as smart folders that organize themselves—no manual filing required. Just dump your thoughts, and we'll sort them into Boards based on what they're actually about.

## How Boards Work

Boards are created automatically based on:

- **Topic similarity**: Drops about the same subject are grouped together
- **Tag patterns**: Drops with similar tags form boards
- **AI analysis**: Our AI identifies themes and creates boards accordingly

## Viewing Boards

Visit the Boards page to see all your boards. Boards are sorted by:

1. **Pinned boards** (at the top)
2. **Recent activity** (most recently updated first)

Each board card shows:

- Board name and description
- Number of notes
- Associated tags
- Last activity time

## Board Details

Click any board to see all drops that belong to it. The board view filters your Stream to show only relevant drops.

## Pinning Boards

Pin important boards to keep them at the top of your list. Click the pin icon on any board card to pin or unpin it.

## Creating Boards

While boards are created automatically, you can also create them manually:

1. Go to the Boards page
2. Click "Create Board"
3. Give it a name and description
4. Add tags to define what drops should belong to it

## Tips

- Boards update automatically as you add new drops—no manual work needed
- Pin your most-used boards for quick access
- Use board tags to control which drops appear in each board
- Don't worry about perfect organization—Boards adapt as your thinking evolves

## Troubleshooting

**Boards Not Updating**
- Wait a few seconds for new drops to be processed
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

**Drops in Wrong Board**
- Boards improve as you add more drops
- You can manually move drops if needed
- The more context you provide, the better the organization

**Too Many Small Boards**
- This is normal when you're just starting
- Boards will merge and consolidate as you add more content
- Give it time—organization improves with more data
