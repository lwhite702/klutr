# MindStorm

MindStorm is where your scattered thoughts become organized intelligence. Using clustering, it automatically groups related notes and reveals connections you might never have noticed. Think of it as your second brain's filing system—one that actually works.

## How Clustering Works

### Automatic Grouping

MindStorm analyzes your notes and groups them based on:

**Content Similarity**

- Notes about similar topics cluster together
- We understand concepts, not just keywords
- Related ideas emerge across different time periods

**Conceptual Relationships**

- Themes that connect across multiple notes
- Ideas that build upon each other
- Patterns in your thinking process

**Temporal Patterns**

- Ideas that emerge together
- Thoughts that develop over time
- Seasonal or cyclical patterns

### The Clustering Process

1. **Content Analysis** - We read and understand each note
2. **Embedding Generation** - Creates mathematical representations of concepts
3. **Similarity Calculation** - Finds notes with similar conceptual meaning
4. **Cluster Formation** - Groups notes above similarity threshold
5. **Continuous Learning** - Clusters improve as you add more notes

The more you dump, the smarter the clustering becomes. Give it time to learn your patterns.

## Exploring Clusters

### Viewing Your Clusters

**Cluster Overview**

- See all clusters at a glance
- Note counts for each cluster
- Recent activity indicators

**Cluster Details**

- Click any cluster to explore its notes
- See how notes relate to each other
- Understand the cluster's theme

**Cluster Evolution**

- Watch clusters grow and change
- See new connections emerge
- Track how your thinking develops

### Understanding Cluster Quality

**Strong Clusters**

- Clear thematic coherence
- Multiple related notes
- Consistent topic focus

**Emerging Clusters**

- New themes taking shape
- Fewer notes but growing
- Potential for future development

**Fragmented Clusters**

- Notes that don't fit elsewhere
- May need manual organization
- Could indicate new topic areas

## Manual Clustering

### Re-clustering

Sometimes you want fresh groupings:

**When to Re-cluster**

- After adding many new notes
- When topics have evolved
- If clusters seem outdated

**How to Re-cluster**

1. Go to MindStorm
2. Click "Re-cluster now"
3. Wait for AI to process
4. Review new groupings

### Cluster Management

**Merge Clusters**

- Combine related clusters
- Useful when topics overlap
- Preserves all notes

**Split Clusters**

- Break large clusters apart
- Create more focused groupings
- Helps with organization

**Rename Clusters**

- Give clusters meaningful names
- Reflect your understanding
- Make navigation easier

## Cluster Insights

### Understanding Patterns

**Topic Evolution**

- See how your interests develop
- Track learning progression
- Identify recurring themes

**Creative Connections**

- Discover unexpected relationships
- Find inspiration in old ideas
- Build upon previous thoughts

**Knowledge Gaps**

- Identify areas needing attention
- Find unexplored connections
- Plan future learning

### Using Clusters for Productivity

**Project Organization**

- Group notes by project or theme
- Track progress over time
- Maintain focus on goals

**Learning Paths**

- Follow knowledge development
- Identify prerequisite concepts
- Plan structured learning

**Creative Development**

- See idea evolution
- Find inspiration sources
- Build upon previous work

## Advanced Features

### Cluster Analytics

**Growth Tracking**

- Monitor cluster development
- See which topics expand
- Identify emerging interests

**Activity Patterns**

- When you think about topics
- Seasonal variations
- Productivity insights

**Connection Strength**

- How closely related notes are
- Cluster coherence metrics
- Quality indicators

### Custom Clustering

**Manual Overrides**

- Force notes into specific clusters
- Create custom groupings
- Override AI suggestions

**Cluster Templates**

- Predefined cluster types
- Consistent organization
- Project-specific structures

**Smart Suggestions**

- AI recommends cluster actions
- Suggests merges or splits
- Identifies optimization opportunities

## Best Practices

### Let Clustering Do the Work

Trust the clustering process. It's designed to find connections you might miss. The algorithm improves as you add more notes, so don't worry if clusters seem off at first.

### Regular Review

Check your clusters weekly to:

- Discover new connections
- Understand your thinking patterns
- Identify areas for development

### Manual Refinement

Use manual clustering sparingly:

- When AI misses obvious connections
- For project-specific organization
- To create custom groupings

### Embrace Discovery

Be open to unexpected connections:

- AI might find patterns you missed
- Cross-pollination between topics
- Creative inspiration from old ideas

## Troubleshooting

### Clusters Seem Wrong

- Wait for more notes to be added
- Try re-clustering manually
- Check if notes have sufficient content

### Too Many Small Clusters

- This is normal with few notes
- Clusters will merge as you add content
- Consider manual merging if needed

### Missing Connections

- Add more descriptive notes
- Include context and details
- Let the AI learn your patterns

### Slow Clustering

- Large note collections take time
- Processing happens in background
- Check your internet connection
