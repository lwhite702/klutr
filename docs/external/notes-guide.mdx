# Notes Guide

Notes are the foundation of your second brain. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, organizing, and managing your thoughts. Whether you're capturing quick ideas or detailed research, we'll help you make the most of Klutr's note-taking capabilities.

## Creating Notes

### QuickCapture Bar

The QuickCapture bar is your primary tool for fast note entry:

- **Location** - Top of the main interface
- **Purpose** - Distraction-free note creation

### What to Capture

Capture anything that crosses your mind:

**Work Notes**

- Research findings

**Personal Thoughts**

- Questions you're pondering
- Goals and aspirations

**Learning Notes**

### Writing Tips

**Be Natural**
Write as you would speak. The AI understands conversational language better than formal writing.

**Include Context**
Add relevant details that help explain your thought:

- Who was involved
- When it happened
- Why it matters
- What you want to remember

**Don't Overthink**
Capture first, organize later. The AI will help you find connections you might miss.

## Understanding Classification

Every note is automatically analyzed and classified:

### Automatic Tags

We add relevant tags based on content:

- **Topic tags** - work, personal, creative, learning
- **Type tags** - meeting, idea, question, reminder
- **Context tags** - urgent, reference, archive, follow-up

Tags help you discover connections and filter your notes quickly.

### Classification Process

1. **Content Analysis** - We read your note content
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies themes and topics
3. **Tag Assignment** - Adds relevant tags automatically
4. **Cluster Assignment** - Groups with similar notes

This all happens automatically in the background—you just write, and we handle the organization.

### Viewing Classifications

- **Below the note** - See tags immediately after creation
- **In note details** - View all classifications and metadata
- **In search results** - Filter by tags and classifications

## Organizing Notes

### Automatic Organization

Notes are automatically organized through:

**Clustering** - Related notes group together in MindStorm
**Stacking** - Smart stacks based on themes and projects

**Tags** - Add custom tags to any note
**Stacks** - Create custom stacks for specific projects

### Capture Everything

Don't filter your thoughts. More notes lead to better AI understanding and more valuable insights.

### Regular Review

- Review insights monthly
- Clean up outdated notes quarterly

### Use Natural Language

Write conversationally. The AI works better with natural, flowing text than bullet points or formal writing.

### Include Context

Add relevant details that help explain your thought. Context makes notes more valuable over time.

### Secure Sensitive Content

Use the Vault for confidential or personal thoughts that shouldn't be processed by AI.

## Troubleshooting

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure note has sufficient content
- Try refreshing the page

### Missing Tags

- Wait a few seconds for AI processing
- Check if note content is clear and descriptive
- Contact support if issues persist

### Search Not Working
